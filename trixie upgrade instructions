1. Start with a bookworm image running the desktop under labwc, and make sure it is up to date with all 
recent changes.
2. Update the apt configuration for trixie.

In the file /etc/apt/sources.list, change every reference to "bookworm" to "trixie".
Do the same in every file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ - on a clean image, this will only involve the 
file raspi.list, but if you have added any other repositories to this directory, their list files should 
also be updated.

3. Run an apt update

4. Upgrade to trixie
sudo apt purge -y raspberrypi-ui-mods
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt full-upgrade -y -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef" -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confnew" --purge --auto-remove
sudo apt install -y rpd-wayland-all rpd-x-all

This line must be entered exactly as above. Make particular note of the plus signs at the end of 
rpd-wayland-all and rpd-x-all. (For trixie, we have obsoleted the raspberrypi-ui-mods package; this has 
been replaced with a number of new packages containing configuration information which make the 
configuration of an image more modular; among other things, these two new packages contain the 
configuration which used to be in ui-mods, and a trixie image will not be correctly configured without 
them.)

On a Pi 5 with a fast connection, the trixie upgrade takes approximately 10 minutes to run. While it is 
running, you will be prompted to ask whether to restart services - answer "yes" to this question; you 
should not have to interact with the process other than that.

At the end, assuming the process completed without errors, it is worth running a "sync" just to make 
sure the file system has cleared all its caches, and then reboot. When the desktop comes back, you can 
confirm that you are now running trixie by opening a terminal and typing "lsb_release -c".
